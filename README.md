# Neovim Config

Just my Neovim config, mainly used for dev.  
The goal was to have something fast, small, ergonomic and with everything I need to code in a comfortable environment.  
I hope I succeeded...

## ✨ Features
- Fast (or at least it should be...)
- Syntax highlighting
- Auto-completion with LSP
- Debugger (DAP) with VSCode Tasks and VSCode Launch integration
- TODO comments
- Fuzzy finder
- Etc...

## ⚡️ Requirements
- Neovim >= 0.9.0
- Git >= 2.19.0 (for partial clone)
- a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) (for nice icons)
- a C compiler (to build stuff)
- Make (also to build stuff)
- Cargo (for some LSP)
- npm (for some LSP)

## 📦 Installation
Just clone the repo in your empty Neovim config directory.

## 🚀 Usage
Well, [which-key](https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim) is installed and the config is relatively small and sorted by plugin, so just look at the config files...
